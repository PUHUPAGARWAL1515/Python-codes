        "Eager Execution by Default: In TF 1.x, you had to define a computational graph first and then execute it in a session. TF 2.0 adopts eager execution, meaning operations are executed immediately as they are called, making debugging and development more intuitive, similar to standard Python.\n",
        "Keras Integration: TensorFlow 2.0 tightly integrates Keras as its high-level API for building and training neural networks. This simplifies model creation and makes it more accessible to beginners.\n",
        "Simplified API: Many redundant and less frequently used functions from TF 1.x have been removed or reorganized, leading to a cleaner and more consistent API.\n",
        "Pythonic Feel: TF 2.0 embraces Pythonic idioms, making the code look and feel more like standard Python.\n",
        "Improved Performance: While TF 1.x had graph optimization, TF 2.0 continues to improve performance through graph compilation (using @tf.function) and optimized kernels.\n",
